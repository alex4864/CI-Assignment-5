	\section{Classiﬁcation/ Clustering}
	\subsection{2 dimensional feature}
	\subsubsection{Perform all of the above-mentioned tasks for the EM algorithm.}
	\subsubsection{Perform all of the above-mentioned tasks for the K-means algorithm}
	\subsubsection{You may additionally choose any other pair of features; how would this change the classiﬁcation accuracy}
	
	\subsection{4 dimensional feature}
	\subsubsection{How do the convergence properties and the accuracy of you classiﬁcation change in comparison to scenario 2.1? }
	\subsubsection{Within your EM-function conﬁne the structure of the covariance matrices to diagonal matrices! What is the inﬂuence on the result.}
	\subsection{Processing the data with PCA }
	\subsubsection{How much of the variance in the data is explained this way?}
	\subsubsection{How does the performance of your algorithms compare to scenario 2.1 and scenario 2.2?}
	\subsubsection{Apply PCA with whitening, so that the transformed data has zero mean and a unit covariance matrix. How does this inﬂuence the choice of your initialization?}
	
	\section{Samples from a Gaussian Mixture Model}
	\subsection{Write a function Y = sample-GMM(alpha, mu, cov, N)}
	\subsection{Using a GMM of your choice$ (K > 3)$, demonstrate the correctness of your function}
